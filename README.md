[JSRedstone](http://github.com/k-o-x/jsredstone) - Javascript Redstone Simulator
================================================================================

Introduction
------------

JSRedstone is a web-based Minecraft Redstone simulator. You can use it to desing, simulate, analyze and debug redstone circuits. As it is built using (nearly) only Javascript, you don't need anything more than a recent web browser to run it.

Launching
---------

To launch JSRedstone, just download a copy of it on your computer and open `jsredstone.html` with your favorite browser. Of course you will need to have Javascript enabled.

Note: due to a [Chrome/Chromium bug](http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=49001), this won't work when accessing it with the `file:` protocol. You'll have to host it on a web server for these browsers.

License
-------

JSRedstone is distributed under the GPLv3 license. See the file `LICENSE` for more information.
